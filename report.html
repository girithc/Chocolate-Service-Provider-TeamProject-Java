<div class="main">
	<h2>Use Case Descriptions</h2>
	
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Write Weekly Reports</p>

</p>
	<p><strong>Extensions: </strong>None</p>
	
	<hr>
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Provider Reports</p>
	<p><strong>Context: </strong>This use case provides reports for each provider who provided ChocAn services that week.</p>
	<p><strong>Actors: </strong>Clock, Manager</p>

	<p><strong>Actors:</strong> List the actors here.</p>
	<p><strong>Main sucess scenario:<br><br></strong>1. The software will search through each service provided that week and total the amount owed to each provider and the number of consultations they had.<br><br>

	<p><strong>Actors: </strong>Clock, Manager</p>
	<p><strong>Main sucess scenario:<br><br></strong>1. Manager indicates a request for the report, or the weekly report is run on its own.<br><br>
	2. The software searches for each instance a Provider performed a service for a member.<br><br> 
	3. The software compiles all of its findings in a single report and calculates totals.<br><br>
	4. The report is returned to the Manager and written to a disk to be sent to banking software automatically.<br><br>
</p>
	<p><strong>Extensions: </strong>None</p>
	
	<hr>

	<hr>
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Bill ChocAn</p>
	<p><strong>Context: </strong>The Provider wants to bill ChocAn for the services they provided to a ChocAn member.</p>
	<p><strong>Actors: </strong>ChocAn Provider</p>
	<p><strong>Main sucess scenario:<br><br></strong> 1. Provider initiates the action and the terminal dials the ChocAn Data Center.
	ChocAn Data Center verifies the member number with member card information (nine digit member number encoded on magnetic stripe) (includes Verify ChocAn Member).<br><br>
	2. If valid, Validated appears on the one-line display.<br><br>
	3. A ChocAn Provider passes the member card through the card reader or keys in the member number.<br><br>
	4. If Validated appears in the terminal, the provider keys in the date the service was provided in the format MM-DD-YYYY.<br><br>
	5. Provider then uses the Provider Directory (includes Use Provider Directory) to look up the appropriate six-digit service code corresponding to the service provided.<br><br>
	6. Provider keys in the service code. If correct, the software product displays the name of the service corresponding to the code (up to 20 characters) and asks the provider to verify that this is the service that was provided.<br><br>
	7. The Provider can enter comments about the service provided.<br><br>	
	8. The software product now writes a service report (includes Write Service Report) that includes the following fields:<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current date and time (MM-DD-YYYY HH:MM:SS)<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date service was provided (MM-DD-YYYY)<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provider number (9 digits)<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member number (9 digits)<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service code (6 digits)<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments (100 characters) (optional)<br><br>
	9. The software product next looks up the service fee (includes Look Up Service Fee) to be paid for that service and displays it on the provider’s terminal.<br><br>
	10. For verification purposes, the provider has a form on which to enter the current date and time, the date and service it was provided, member name and number, service code, and fee to be paid.<br><br>
	11. At the end of the week, the provider totals the fees to verify the amount to be paid to that provider by ChocAn for that week.
</p>
	<p><strong>Extensions:<br><br></strong>
		3a. If invalid, it could be that an invalid number was entered, or the member was suspended because the member has not paid fees for at least a month.<br><br>
      4a. Error messages are printed if nonexistent code is entered.
</p>
	
	<hr>
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Use Provider Directory</p>
	<p><strong>Context: </strong>ChocAn Provider wants to use Provider Directory to look up service code.</p>
	<p><strong>Actors: </strong>ChocAn Provider</p>
	<p><strong>Main sucess scenario:<br><br></strong> 1. ChocAn Provider accesses the Provider Directory from the ChocAn Provider Terminal.<br><br>
	2. ChocAn Provider can then complete the action of finding the appropriate service code by looking it up in the Provider Directory (includes Look Up Service Fee). 
</p>
	<p><strong>Extensions:<br><br></strong> 2a. If no code is found, a message is displayed saying that no results were found.</p>
	
	<hr>
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Look Up Service Fee</p>

	<p><strong>Actors: </strong>ChocAn Provider</p>
	<p><strong>Main sucess scenario:<br><br></strong> 1. After finding the service code for the service the Provider provided to the ChocAn member and completing the writing of the service report, the software product next looks up the service fee to be paid for that service.<br><br>
	2. This fee is displayed on the ChocAn Provider’s terminal.
</p>
	<p><strong>Extensions:<br><br></strong>2a. If something is added to the service report that is invalid, the fee will not display and an error message should be displayed indicating which parameter of the report is invalid.</p>
	
	<hr>
	<p><strong>Use case: </strong>Write Service Report</p>
	<p><strong>Context: </strong>ChocAn Provider wants to generate a service report detailing the service provided to the ChocAn member.</p>

	2. The Provider can enter comments about the service provided.<br><br>
	3. The software product now writes a service report that includes the following fields:<br><br>
